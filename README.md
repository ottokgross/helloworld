# helloworld
yet another repository in a world over-run with repositories
Where do I start? taking a R language class and will be using github so I thought I'd do  a refresher. I'm a Linux/Unix Sys Admin. Old Bell Labs guy. Started in Unix on DEC PDP's . Booting by toggling switches to set bits in a register manually. Paper tape was revolutionary and eight inch floppies on Vax were a work of mystical proportions. What a ride it's been.
